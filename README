Experimental software, only used for testing.

VM firewall rules are read from /etc/pve/firewall/<VMID>.fw

You can find examples in the example/ dir

Use the following command to generate shorewall configuration:

./pvefw compile

That command overwrites /etc/shorewall/, so don't use if you have
and existing shorewall config you want to keep.
